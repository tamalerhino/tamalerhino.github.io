## Long Story Short...
I got started in the 5th grade when i wanted to run a Doom server at school to play with my friends, so i put Slackware(R.I.P) on a USB stick and plugged it into a PC in the library and the rest as they say is history.

I used to be a professional magician/mentalist ....just google my name.... 
Now i just like to hack and automate all of the things!

I love talking about all things DevOps/DevSecOps Blockchain, Security/Hacking, and Containerization. 
Favorite languages and tools include but are not limited to:

- Terraform
- Nomad
- Hashi Vault
- Consul
- Python
- Ruby
- Chef/Habitat
- Ansible
- Docker/Podman
- Kubernetes
- OpenFaaS
- Kali Linux, or any Linux Distro for that matter
- WiFi Pineapples and WiFi penetration testing
- I'm also really into z/OS (mainframe)
- Random hacking obscure stuff on the internet.
- And all things Blockchain
